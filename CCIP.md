## Overview

The **CCIP (Continuously Computed Impact Point)** reticle is an advanced fire control system that provides real-time aiming solution for weapon systems. Unlike traditional crosshair reticles that require manual compensation, CCIP automatically calculates and displays where your projectile will impact, accounting for:

- Ballistic trajectory (bullet drop)
- Platform motion (if you're moving)
- Target motion (if target is moving)
- Environmental factors (wind, gravity)
- Range to target

### System Philosophy

**"Aim at the pipper, fire when confident"** - The system does all ballistic calculations; the operator simply aligns the pipper with the target and monitors confidence level.

## Reticle Components

### 1. Center Pipper (⊙)

````
        ⊙
    (12px radius)
```

**Purpose:** Shows **exactly where your projectile will impact**

**Components:**
- Outer circle (12 pixel radius)
- Inner filled dot (2 pixel radius)

**What it compensates for:**
- Gravity (bullet drop)
- Initial velocity
- Your platform's motion
- Target's motion (if LAC active)
- Wind effects (if configured)

**Usage:** Always aim this symbol at your intended target. The pipper moves relative to your crosshair as ballistic factors change.

---

### 2. Flight Path Vector - FPV (__|__)
```
    __|__
    
   (wings)
```

**Purpose:** Shows the **direction your platform is currently moving**

**Design:**
- Horizontal wings (20 pixels each side)
- Vertical tips (6 pixels upward)
- Gap in center (12 pixels)

**Key Concept:**
- If **FPV = Pipper** → You're stationary or moving directly toward target
- If **FPV ≠ Pipper** → You're moving, system is compensating

**Example:**
```
  FPV          Pipper
  __|__          ⊙

You're moving left, but system has compensated the aim point right
```

---

### 3. LAC Bracket (┌─)
```
        ┌─────
        │
        │
    ────┘
    
(L-shaped corner)
```

**Purpose:** Visual indicator that **Lead Angle Compensation is ACTIVE**

**When it appears:**
- Target is moving
- System has valid velocity vector
- Lead calculation is being applied

**Positioning:** Typically appears near the pipper as a frame element

**What it means:**
- ✓ System is tracking target motion
- ✓ Pipper position includes lead calculation
- ✓ Aiming ahead of target's current position

---

### 4. Range Scale
```
                    2000m ────
                    1500m ───
                    1000m ──
                     500m ─
````

**Purpose:** Visual reference for target distance with **dynamic highlighting**

**Features:**

- Four reference distances: 500m, 1000m, 1500m, 2000m
- Tick marks of varying length
- Current range bracket highlights (brighter/different color)

**Highlighting Logic:**

javascript

~~~javascript
Target at 1400m → 1500m line highlights (within ±250m)
Target at 650m  → No highlight (between brackets)
Target at 2100m → 2000m highlights (max range indicator)
```

**Visual Feedback:**
- **Bright/Highlighted** = Your current range bracket
- **Dim** = Not your current range
- **Line length** = Proportional to distance (closer = shorter)

    ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░  (80% confidence)
    ▓▓▓▓░░░░░░  (40% confidence)
    ▓░░░░░░░░░  (10% confidence)
```

**Purpose:** Shows **reliability of the ballistic solution** (0-100%)

**Color Coding:**

| Confidence | Color | Meaning | Action |
|------------|-------|---------|--------|
| **> 70%**  | 🟢 Green | High confidence | Safe to fire |
| **40-70%** | 🟡 Yellow | Medium confidence | Caution advised |

## Visual Situations

### Situation 1: Stationary Platform + Static Target
**Scenario:** You're standing still, target is stationary
```
                                    2000m ────
                                    1500m ───
         __|__                      1000m ──
           ⊙                         500m ─
        
        ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓                    (Confidence: 85%, Green)
```

**Interpretation:**
- ✓ FPV and pipper overlap (no relative motion)
- ✓ No LAC bracket (target not moving)
- ✓ High confidence (stable solution)
- ✓ No range bracket lit (target between reference distances)

**Action:** Simple shot - aim center dot at target, fire when ready

---

### Situation 2: Moving Platform + Static Target
**Scenario:** You're moving left, target is stationary
```
                                    2000m ────
         __|__                      1500m ─── ★
                                    1000m ──
              ⊙                      500m ─
           
        ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░                  (Confidence: 80%, Green)
```

**Interpretation:**
- ⚠️ FPV (left) ≠ pipper (right) → You're moving left
- ✓ System compensated pipper to the right
- ✓ 1500m bracket highlighted (target ~1400m away)
- ✓ Good confidence despite motion

**Action:** Aim pipper at target (NOT where FPV points), system handles compensation

---

### Situation 3: Static Platform + Moving Target
**Scenario:** You're stationary, target moving right
```
                            ┌───── LAC Active!
                            │
         __|__              │       2000m ────
           ⊙  ◄─────────────┘       1500m ───
                                    1000m ── ★
                                     500m ─
        
        ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓                (Confidence: 95%, Green)
```

**Interpretation:**
- ✓ LAC bracket visible → Lead compensation ON
- ✓ Pipper leads ahead of target's current position
- ✓ 1000m bracket highlighted (target ~950m)
- ✓ Excellent confidence (good track)

**Action:** Track target, keep pipper on target, fire when pipper aligned

---

### Situation 4: Moving Platform + Moving Target
**Scenario:** Both you and target are moving
```
                            ┌───── LAC Active
                            │
         __|__              │       2000m ────
                            │       1500m ───
                     ⊙  ◄───┘       1000m ──
                                     500m ─ ★
        
        ▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░                  (Confidence: 50%, Yellow)
```

**Interpretation:**
- ⚠️ FPV and pipper widely separated → Complex motion scenario
- ⚠️ LAC active → Target also moving
- ⚠️ Close range (500m) + dual motion = challenging shot
- ⚠️ Medium confidence (50%, yellow) → Marginal solution

**Action:** Wait for confidence to improve or stabilize relative motion

---

### Situation 5: Lost Track / Poor Solution
**Scenario:** Track lost or insufficient data
```
         __|__                      2000m ────
           ⊙                        1500m ───
                                    1000m ──
                                     500m ─
        
        ▓░░░░░░░░░                  (Confidence: 10%, RED)
```

**Interpretation:**
- ❌ RED confidence bar → Unreliable solution
- ❌ System cannot guarantee accuracy
- ❌ May indicate: poor track, lost LRF, bad data

**Action:** **DO NOT FIRE** - Reacquire target or wait for track to stabilize

---

### Situation 6: Extreme Range
**Scenario:** Target at maximum effective range
```
                                    2000m ──── ★
         __|__                      1500m ───
           ⊙                        1000m ──
                                     500m ─
        
        ▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░                  (Confidence: 60%, Yellow)
```

**Interpretation:**
- ⚠️ 2000m bracket highlighted (near max range)
- ⚠️ Confidence degraded at extreme distance
- ⚠️ Environmental factors more significant
- ⚠️ Longer time-of-flight = more uncertainty

**Action:** Consider closing distance or accept lower hit probability

---

## Operational Guidelines

### Pre-Fire Checklist

1. ✓ **Confidence bar is GREEN** (>70%)
2. ✓ **Pipper stable** (not jumping erratically)
3. ✓ **Range scale shows valid distance** (highlighted bracket)
4. ✓ **Target identified** (correct target, no friendlies)
5. ✓ **Clear firing solution** (no obstructions)
6. ✓ **Weapon armed and ready**

### Aiming Procedure

**Step 1: Acquire Target**

- Use optics to locate and identify target
- Ensure clear line of sight

**Step 2: Obtain Range**

- Activate LRF (Laser Range Finder)
- Verify range reading on scale
- Wait for range bracket to highlight

**Step 3: Establish Track**

- Keep target in field of view
- System automatically tracks
- Watch for LAC bracket if target moving

**Step 4: Monitor Confidence**

- Observe confidence bar color
- Wait for GREEN (>70%)
- If yellow/red, wait or reposition

**Step 5: Align Pipper**

- Place pipper center dot on target
- **Ignore where FPV points**
- Keep smooth tracking motion

**Step 6: Fire**

- When pipper aligned + confidence green
- Smooth trigger press
- Maintain aim through firing

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Aiming at FPV instead of pipper**

- FPV shows YOUR motion, not where to aim
- Always aim the pipper circle

❌ **Firing with low confidence**

- Red/yellow bar = high miss probability
- Wait for green or reacquire

❌ **Ignoring LAC bracket**

- When LAC active, target is moving
- Must maintain continuous track

❌ **Poor range data**

- If no range bracket lights up, solution may be invalid
- Re-lase target with LRF

❌ **Over-correction**

- System does all calculations automatically
- Don't try to "help" by leading manually

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Pipper jumps erratically

**Possible Causes:**

- Poor target track
- Intermittent range data
- Heavy platform vibration
- Target moving unpredictably

**Solutions:**

1. Stabilize platform (enable stabilization if available)
2. Re-lase target for fresh range data
3. Wait for target to move predictably
4. Switch to manual mode if CCIP unreliable

------

### Problem: Confidence always low (yellow/red)

**Possible Causes:**

- LRF not locking properly
- Extreme range (>2000m)
- High relative velocities
- System not calibrated

**Solutions:**

1. Check LRF functionality
2. Close distance to target
3. Wait for relative motion to decrease
4. Perform system calibration
5. Check environmental sensors

------

### Problem: LAC bracket appears/disappears rapidly

**Possible Causes:**

- Target velocity near threshold
- Poor track quality
- System switching between modes

**Solutions:**

1. Improve track stability (smooth tracking)
2. Wait for clear target motion
3. May indicate marginal tracking - check confidence

------

### Problem: No range bracket highlights

**Possible Causes:**

- Target range between brackets (e.g., 750m, 1250m)
- LRF data invalid
- Range exceeds scale (>2500m or <250m)

**Solutions:**

1. Normal if between brackets - not an error
2. If no range at all, re-lase target
3. Close/increase distance to get within scale

------

### Problem: FPV and pipper very far apart

**Possible Causes:**

- High platform velocity
- Extreme angle to target
- Normal for certain motion scenarios

**Solutions:**

- Usually normal operation
- System compensating for motion
- If confidence is green, solution is valid
- Reduce platform velocity if uncomfortable
